            <h4>How much does SEO Cost in Dubai?</h4>
            <span><i class="ri-arrow-right-wide-line"></i></span> 
          </summary>
          <p>TThere is no definitive answer to this question, as SEO costs can vary depending on 
            the size and scope of the project, the level of technical expertise required, 
            and the specific needs of the target audience. However, a ballpark estimate 
            for SEO costs in Dubai might range from 1500 to 5000 Aed per month.</p>
